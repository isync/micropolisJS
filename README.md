micropolisJS
============

Clone or download, then serve locally or just [play Micropolis online here](https://www.games-db.com/play/micropolis/), for example.

Depending on your version, you may encounter problems running locally on Chrome due to the way Chrome handles security context for file URIs.
You may wish to replace the tileset URI with the data URI in TileSetURI.

A port of Micropolis to JS/HTML5 by [graememcc](https://github.com/graememcc/). Licensed under the GPLv3, with some additional terms - please be mindful of these.
